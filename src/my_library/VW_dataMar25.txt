Title: Why a Groom-To-Be Should Have a Stag Do

Content: Why a Groom-To-Be Should Have a Stag Do Ball and chain jokes aside, there are some excellent reasons why every groom to be should have a stag do before tying the knot – and none of them include your married mates pleading with you for an excuse to leave the house. The stag dos of today are somewhat different from those not all so long ago, and there are some excellent reasons why it’s actually advisable to go all out and enjoy – what has become for many stag dos – not only a crazy night but a full-blown overseas holiday for a groom to be and his closest mates. Those who care about you won’t miss it and those who aren’t so bothered have an excuse for not coming along. If you’re to hold your stag do overseas, as has become the norm to a great extent, there’s going to be some spending involved. Seeing that your closest mates wouldn’t miss your stag do for the world – admittedly so will those looking for an excuse to party – you’ll find out who your real mates are. You’ll have the chance to see something of the world by taking an overseas holiday. Admittedly you mightn’t get to see all the ‘cultural’ bits and pieces of cities like Amsterdam, Prague or Riga – three of the top destinations for stag do revellers in Europe, but you will however, have a great time partying in wonderful places around the world. Furthermore, at a later point in time you may even wish to take your beautiful bride on holiday there to show her what you saw– if you dare. You’ll have the chance to try something new. Stag dos offer everyone, and not only the groom to be, the opportunity to try something new, something wild perhaps, and certainly something fun. If it wasn’t for stag dos, it’s unlikely so many would have ever discovered the fun and thrills of activities like go-karting and paintballing, along with what is no doubt every stag do reveller’s favourite – mud wrestling. You’ll actually be able to arrive sober at your wedding. If there ever was a line to hit your lovely bride to be with as an excuse for heading to Riga with your mates – this is it. Seeing that the stag do became a stag weekend – and in some cases a ‘stag week’ – there has been much less emphasis placed on going out for a wild night the night before the wedding. Nowadays it’s far more common for a stag party to be held a week, or even a fortnight, before the wedding with the result that the night before has become much tamer. Furthermore, it has also significantly reduced the likelihood of the groom to be turning up to his wedding drunk and dishevelled. You’ll have the opportunity to do something memorable with your closest mates. This is another excellent reason for holding stag dos overseas or in other parts of the country, though it’s one that takes some thought, planning and of course timing –something exciting has to be going on.

Title: Vasilias Nikoklis History

Content: Vasilias Nikoklis history is long and goes way back. Was previously an ancient khan, a place for travelers to rest and feed both themselves and their animals. The original building , the ground floor consisting the sitting area, the winter taverna, 2 bedrooms and internal yard, is calculated to be more than 100 years old it was given as a wedding present to the owners Tassos and Dora Konstantinou. They were given not just a present but a dream that needed to be fulfilled. During 1980 the owners started to renovate the ruins and run it firstly as a taverna. It took many years to bring the building at today’s stage, lots of hard work , lots of efforts just to see their dream come true! After some successful years as a taverna they moved on to the next step which was to create another floor consisting of 6 bedrooms, having in total 8 rooms in which 16 guests can be accommodated. Nowadays the inn is managed by the next generation of the Konstantinou family. Experience and knowledge are combined together with great success, having only one aim, to make visitors and house guests experience Cyprus tradition and hospitality and of course feel like home!

Title: Beautiful Colours and Sustainable Jewellery--You Can Have it all!

Content: Sustainable Jewellery You may have heard of sustainable jewellery but do you know what it means for jewellery to be of this nature? Any jewellery that is produced with the goal in mind of environmentalism and social responsibility can be considered sustainable. Many jewellery companies have moved toward the mentality of sustainable jewellery as the trend is continuing to grow worldwide. With so much focus on blood diamonds, and protecting the environment, any diamond jewellery company is wise to focus on creating product lines that are sustainable. A notable effort, a diamond certification system, introduced by the UN a few years ago will further support the effort to eliminate conflict diamonds and focus on selling sustainable jewellery. Trendy Accessories in Australia In Australia, diamond jewellery is every popular and can be seen in different trendy accessories. Whether real or fake, diamonds can be seen in clothing and fashionable jewellery. Diamond encrusted heels on shoes has become a growing trend for the glamorous girl. Men’s jewellery has also seen an increase in diamonds, mainly in pendants and wedding rings. Black diamonds in particular are used regularly in men’s jewellery for a masculine and sophisticated look in jewellery. Perhaps the most timeless and elegant accessory for a woman are diamond stud earrings. Even the smallest of diamond studs can make a beautiful and feminine statement on a woman’s ears. In the case of online shopping, one can find a great deals through many discount retailers. Retailers online offer many styles of fashionable jewellery in the area of diamond earrings. Jewellery can come in many styles such as: princess cut, oval cut, marquise cut, diamond hoops, and of course the classic round cut. As far as colours are concerned, diamond studs have moved away from the traditional white diamond and moved into some beautiful and unique colours such as pink, yellow, red, green, black, and purple. Keep in mind any of these colours (which are considered “fancy” colours) can be extremely expensive if they are a natural stone, as they are very rare. If you do have the ability to purchase a fancy colour, you will not be disappointed. When shopping for a diamond, make sure you are aware of the four C’s: Colour, Clarity, Carat, and Cut. Each of these factors will have an impact on the price of the diamond. If you cannot afford a pair of diamond stud earrings with flawless stones (as of course, many cannot) keep in mind what you are willing to sacrifice. Maybe you don’t need a colourless diamond and will accept a little gray or yellow tint. In this case, you would save a lot of money and be able to purchase a larger size set of diamond earrings. If colour and clarity are important to you, you may want to decide on a smaller cut (size) set of diamonds as you might easier find a pair within your budget. In any case, make sure you know where the diamonds are coming from and look into purchasing the best diamonds for sale in Brisbane can offer, just make sure that they are from a reputable retailer—preferably one that offers sustainable jewellery. Author Bio: Jennifer Watson is a lover of all things about fashion. She is always looking at new pieces of jewelry in the market today. She likes all kinds of fashion and jewellery related stuff.

Title: Advice For Writing Your Own Marriage Vowels

Content: Some of us just aren’t that good with words. Furthermore, since our wedding vows are amongst the most important words we’ll ever say, it’s only natural that many people will suffer from writer’s block and struggle to find the right words to say when setting out on composing the vows themselves. All in all then, it’s fair to say that producing one’s own wedding vows is no easy task for many of us. Here are a few tips on doing so then to help make the task somewhat easier. Prepare Early The first and foremost thing that needs to be considered when composing your own wedding vows is to start early and never leave it late. It’s simple common sense that the earlier you leave it, the more time you will have to prepare and the more thought you will be able to inject into the vows, which can only do you good. It’s best to start writing your vows at least a month before the wedding. Keep Vows In Your Pocket Unfortunately, inspiration and creativity aren’t always available or readily available at request. It is therefore important to keep your vows with you wherever you are, or at least keep a pen and paper – or your phone – with you wherever you are, in case you suddenly need to record a few words to add to your vows. Read Novels The more you read, the better you will be at writing, which will hold you in good stead when needing to compose your wedding vows. Classic novels are most beneficial when it comes to improving your writing skills and the better the novel, the better your writing will be as a result of reading it. It is obviously preferable for such novels to be romance books, however in truth, any genre will improve the quality of your vows. Online Advice it comes to searching for advice on any topic or theme, the internet should be your best friend and this is no different for those looking to compose their wedding vows. There are a number of blogs such as this one or www.weddingsite.co.uk, which can help you with advice on vows – as well as weddings and marriage in general for that matter. Set The Tone You must remember that your vows need to be confined to a specific tone. You will best know what tone you want to achieve, however there are a few general rules that you ought to adhere to. Firstly, your tone should always be romantic – needless to say. It should also come from the heart and resonate with truthfulness and sincerity – even if it is rather lighthearted and even funny. Furthermore, if you do choose to make your vows lighthearted and funny, you must be sure to always keep a strong element of seriousness in it, as marriage is no trivial affair. If you’re not great at jokes, then you should steer clear from telling them in your marriage vows. There is nothing more cringe worthy than a joke that doesn’t pull off in front of several people. When this failed joke occurs throughout one’s wedding vows, it will obviously amount to a major disaster. It is far better to be completely serious than to fail at attempting to be funny. Relax And Speak From The Heart The final and perhaps most important piece of advice for those composing their own wedding vows is to simply relax and speak from the heart. The phrase “speak from the heart” is one that’s often thrown around rather meaninglessly, however it is completely true for pronouncing one’s vows. You must speak to your partner, as if no one else is around. After all, you’re simply telling him or her how much you love them.

Here are some easy tips you can remember: The first and foremost tip is that your bridal attire, your hair, makeup and your jewellery should complement one another. The perfect co-ordination of all these accessories will make you beautiful beyond words. Unadorned hair is beautiful, those cascading locks of hair falling down your shoulders is enough to make you look stunning. As a second tip, remember to buy hair extensions to add volume and bounce to your hair. But it is your wedding day and you have to take special care to adorn your hair. If you wish to let down your hair, then you need to choose weighty accessories, not the dainty ones. On the other hand, if you choose to wear your hair in a bun, you can go for all those delicate ones. Maybe a high ballerina style would make you stunning, see what your wedding/makeup consultant would tell you. Third tip. When you buy your bridal attire, you check out everything, even to the last detail and from all angles. Similarly, you must spend time and check the hairpiece for any minute flaws. If it doesn't suit your hairstyle or your gown, remove it. Of course, to complement with the gown, the hairpiece should be a perfect match. But that doesn't mean they should be of the same colour. A hairpiece made of metal would be a perfect match for a vintage-style gown. For a modern gown, you can choose one embedded with crystals. A Final tip. The headpiece should be placed at a strategic point. Your look can change based on where you place it. The higher you place the comb, the dramatic you are going to look. You can create a completely different look by placing it flat against your head. A last word: Your accessories should enhance your looks not distract people. Based on these tips, you can proceed with your wedding plans. Meanwhile you can check out this site for more tips - http://www.weddingandgems.co.uk/.

Title: Top 7 Tips for Popping the Question

Content: Popping the question is the most daunting task most men ever face, and rightly so, seeing as so much rides on her saying ‘Yes!’, so leave nothing to chance by taking these handy tips into account, and don’t forget the ring! Image Source: http://www.chacha.com/gallery/4537/romantic-ways-to-propose Avoid the expected Although some women aren’t remotely shy about hinting at a date they’re expecting to be proposed to on – and you won’t want to disappoint them there – it’s all part of the magical proposal process to avoid the unexpected by proposing to them at a time they least expect. Whilst expected dates are something to avoid, the engagement ring she’s been expecting isn’t, though if you’re proposing with a ring she isn’t expecting – make sure it surpasses her expectations. Be prepared Preparation is key here, though you could continue to bumble about if she finds that endearing. Prepare the proposal well in advance and don’t leave anything to chance by thinking about everything that could go wrong and planning accordingly. It’s probably advantageous to allow yourself some room to move but don’t deviate off course too much. Surprise don’t shock In an age of extreme proposals many men, and indeed quite a few women, have set themselves the task of shocking their partners with extreme proposals that have the tendency to backfire – often in a big way. The art of proposing involves surprises, not shocks, plus you don’t want them to have a heart attack after being arrested or something similarly outlandish. Don’t leave a trail This follows on from the previous point in that proposals should be surprising, perhaps they suspect something is up and they’ll no doubt want something to happen, but try your hardest to keep the surprise a surprise. Depending on what you’ve planned, don’t leave receipts for engagement jewellery lying around, make restaurant or hotel reservations when she’s not present and if you choose to tell your friends – they might be able to make suggestions or even help out with the surprise – ensure they keep quiet! Make it personal The proposal should be a personal experience so treat it like you’re appealing to their interests, senses and tastes – which you are in many regards – by planning the proposal around what they’re interested in and what they like, not what you’re into. This is also the case with the ring accompanying the question, give some thought to the jewellery she likes but don’t ask questions which will give the surprise away. Relax – don’t blurt! Daunting, stressful, troubling, worrisome – these are all adjectives that could easily describe an otherwise usually composed man prior to popping the question even though he’s done everything right, including procuring the perfect diamond engagement ring from thediamondstore. It’s only natural that a man would be nervous before he pops the big question – proposals are after all the time in which a man is exposed more so than any other time in his life – take a big breath, or three, and say what you’ve practiced saying a million times, even if you fluff it she’ll still be overjoyed. Don’t forget how memorable it was – take photos! How memorable was that proposal? A good question and one that a few years later both you and your spouse might be struggling to answer – so take photos! If you’ve proposed in a restaurant or public place ask someone else to take a couple of photos, if the people near you are aware that you’ve just proposed and she’s accepted they’ll be very happy to take a photo to help you preserve the special moment – who wouldn’t? About the Author: TheDiamondStore is a jewellery business based in London. Some of the items they offer include pendants, necklaces, bracelets, earrings, and rings.

Many locations and venues available but most important is to find the wedding venue which matches your requirements. Today we are going to talk about rustic wedding theme. What is rustic for those who do not understand the meaning of the word is : something traditional, country side themed, not modern , old, typical architecture and style if it comes for a building, earth colors if it comes for fabric and decorations. Rustic wedding theme has been always popular especially if you are having your wedding in a Mediterranean country like Cyprus, it all goes together, the color of the sky, the earthy feeling of the environment, the olive trees the traditional character found in many locations and places. [caption id="attachment_2018" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Rustic wedding decorations[/caption] So lets start with that check list! Having a rustic wedding theme is not only buying hessian material is many more: 1) First most important is the wedding venue. Have i found the venue which fits perfectly for my rustic theme? You can have a rustic theme anywhere but it stands out when you choose the ideal place 2) Check out as many photos as you can find on the web for this venue. Is important to get the right feedback and idea of how this place looks like. If you can arrange a pre wedding visit abroad well this is perfect, but do you know how many couples book their wedding in Cyprus with out even visiting the island once? Believe me many...and they are not disappointed. 3) Find out what the venue has to offer for your decoration arrangements, for example at Vasilias you can receive through our decoration package wooden chairs, hessian runners, white chair sashes, hanging wooden love hearts, fairy lights, crisp white linen, matching ribbons, jam jars and vases, lanterns, oil burn lanterns, lace, wooden centerpieces, homemade favors, just name what you want. This will save you lots of time and money to buy and transfer all the items you want to add on your table and venue. 4) Choose your colors, keeping it rustic means your color themes are based on earth - pale - soft colors, most popular comes white, light brown, peach, baby pink, light yellow, mint green...etc. 5) Get ideas! A very popular side is Pinterest there you can find thousands of rustic themed wedding photos, this is what i do every time i need something new to improve our wedding services at Vasilias 6) Check out with the venue what is there else to provide apart from your table decorations , if there are any wooden tables available - perfect for a fresh lemonade bar or a candy bar. 7) Flower arrangements : Ideally any spring country side flowers will do, but dont forget, you are planning your rustic wedding in Cyprus, where due to weather conditions not all flowers are available through the year, or if they are you will need to be aware of the cost, since many are imported. [caption id="attachment_2102" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Rustic wedding in Cyprus[/caption] 8) Materials: Lace Lace Lace! Rustic goes with lace and light materials, you can easily throw in your suitcase some meters of material to use around the venue and your tables, if you have no idea how to add it to your decoration theme, just leave your planner or house manager to arrange it for you. Ideally they will have the experience to make the best arrangement for you. 9) Simplicity: Rustic is simple, you just blend the local characteristics of a place with your rustic bits and pieces. No need to over do it, being in a rustic venue of all of my life i realized how many decors are available around offered by the nature and free! 10) Keep calm and trust the planner! I always get excited when brides come with their decors and arrangements, each lady has her own style and imagination, the perfect team i call it : A calm and imaginative bride + a fast and easy going wedding planner = very very nice result! Happy rustic wedding planning! xx

Title: How To Choose Stunning Bridesmaid Dresses

Content: How To Choose Stunning Bridesmaid Dresses If you’re the bride to be, you’ll know how hard it can be to keep everyone happy and to keep everyone and everything organised. Something like bridesmaids dresses is fairly integral to the day, you want everyone to look good but you also want them all to be happy. Finding the right balance takes a little bit of planning, but it’s easier than you may think. There are a few factors you need to keep in mind when choosing dresses for your bridesmaids, here are just a few: Keep them happy – As much as this is your big day, the last thing you want to do is annoy all the bridesmaids by not asking or including them in the dress choosing process. You want them to be fully involved so you know who is and isn’t happy at all times. Some of them may have to compromise slightly, but it’s better to have 3 content bridesmaids over 1 happy and 2 angry ones. Sizes, shapes and styles – You need to make sure that whatever dresses you choose, that they all match well with your bridesmaids equally. You can’t choose skinny style dresses should one of your bridesmaids be a couple of sizes bigger than the rest, it could leave them feeling left out. You need to find a style that suits all your maids body shapes and sizes. You’ll also need to consider certain styles such as trumpet dresses, flowy dresses etc. Materials – You may not even think twice about the materials of the dress, but some people can be allergic to certain materials and others may have certain needs or are even against any materials. You want to make sure that none of your maids will be chaffed on the day and you also don’t want to be causing any rashes to those with sensitive skin. These girls are going to be wearing these dresses all day, so they need to be as comfortable as possible. Don’t outshine the bride – As harsh as it sounds the last thing you want to do is make all your maids much prettier and better presented than you, especially if you’re spending an arm and a leg to be the main attraction. Choose dresses that flatter them all, but don’t let the dresses give them all the attention. Most brides will choose more conservative dresses for the maids that are not as revealing, so that the brides dress has more appeal. Matching everyone–Not everyone will want to wear the same dress, you may find yourself in a predicament where all your maids want different styles and colours. You can be firm and give them guidelines, but if it’s what they really want then just make sure that they’re supervised by yourself. Keep all the dresses the same kind of colours and don’t let the styles be too different from dress to dress. Give them unity with unique dresses, sounds hard but it can be done with a little bit of patience! AUTHOR BIO: Jade Waddy is an experienced writer with an NOCN leven 3 in journalism.

Here are a number of factors to put your mind at ease allowing you to enjoy your day to the fullest: Cost There may be those little extras you have completely forgot about, and with weddings becoming increasingly expensive (the average now costs over £20,000!) it makes sense to prepare your financial situations before stepping on the plane.

Title: DIY Wedding Tips/Advice

Content: Ensuring that your wedding has the perfect backdrop is probably high on your list of priorities when preparing for your special day. Hiring a specialist wedding planner to do the design of their venue for them is what most people do, however more and more of us nowadays are opting for a DIY approach to wedding design. DIY designing your special occasion has a number of advantages. First and foremost, it is obviously cheaper, since you won’t have to pay any wedding planners. Furthermore, it allows you to take full control of a day that’s so important you’ll need as much power over it as possible. Here are a few DIY wedding tips and advice. Financial Shrewdness If the main reason for you going DIY on your wedding is money, than you will need to ensure that you make choices and decisions that actually work to save you money. While it can be cheaper to DIY your own wedding, it can also be more expensive if you choose the wrong options. Try to make things yourself if buying them proves to be too expensive. Also explore hiring fixtures and furniture that might be too expensive to buy. Time You must also acknowledge that a DIY wedding takes time, as well as physical and mental exhaustion. Since wedding preparations are stressful and drawn out enough as it is, you must ask yourself whether or not you’ll actually have the time and strength to do things yourself. The Relationship Between Your Budget & Guestlist There is a relationship between your budget and your guestlist. In essence, the bigger the guestlist, the bigger the budget. Don’t Be Afraid To Get A Little Help Whilst you may be keen on doing things yourself, the money and time a professional planner can save you can be invaluable. You should therefore try to hire a professional planner on a limited basis. In that sense you will end up getting the best of both worlds in a way – boasting greater power over your wedding whilst saving money, without an overabundance of hard String another nail best great store a in rhinestones levitra manufacture in canada book competitions.

Areas the wedding planner can help in are matters that are strongly related to health and safety. Lighting installation for example should be in the hands of a wedding planner if you do not feel comfortable doing this yourself. You can buy the lighting fixtures yourself, from the likes of IKEA or www.lampcommerce.com. However, unless you’re skilled enough, you should hire an expert to deal with the installation. Creative Money-Saving Locations If you’re looking for a memorable wedding location that isn’t super-pricey, you should consider a forest or park that costs nothing. The weather will of course need to be perfect for the occasion and so you’re better off choosing a day that’s in the summer. However, such venue ideas are costless, whilst being memorable, innovative and creative. Fall Leafed Bouquet If you’re getting married in autumn, you can save money on a bouquet by arranging yours from picked up fall leaves. Add a few berries and you’ll have a beautiful and dirt-cheap bouquet, that’s also chic and creative.

Title: Perfect Flowers for Hot Weather Weddings

Content: Flowers play an important role in weddings. Whether you are planning a fall, summer, autumn or winter wedding, fresh bouquets always add a burst of color to any wedding arrangement. There are so many options of blooms no matter what season it is but you also have to consider the type of weather and the temperature on the wedding day since there are flower varieties that may not hold well in high temperatures. Here are the top flower picks for a wedding in hot weather. Calla lilies Calla lilies are pretty sensitive to cold but they are extremely tolerant of warm temperatures. In fact, calla lilies can survive for some time without a ready water source. They are prone to bruising during shipping, however, so it is best to buy your flowers from a local source and get the flowers yourself to ensure that they are properly handled. Apart from being tolerant of warmer temperatures, calla lilies are also fairly inexpensive and tend to provide beautiful and elegant accents to any wedding.

Orchids can stay fresh until the afternoon whether you are using the blooms for a bouquet or as a groom's boutonnière. Orchids can maintain their dewy appearance even without a water source. They also make great accents to any table centerpiece. Orchids also have a gentle scent which is not too overpowering, making them perfect for the bridal bouquet. The many options in colors also mean that they can work great with any wedding theme.

This flower is good as a centerpiece or as a flower girl's ball. The rich blue color of hydrangeas add a touch of cool color to any wedding theme and they can brighten up any table with their soft, vibrant petals. They are also favorite accents for the wedding cake since the petals are small and delicately-shaped.

Roses are hardy and can stand up to hot weather. They are also great options for the cake, the centerpieces, bridal bouquets, flower girl balls and even for the groom and his groomsmen. You are not limited to red and its variations, since white and cream are also popular options.

This is one factor that you should look in flowers for hot weather weddings, since there are many varieties of flowers that easily wilt and die when exposed to warm temperatures. The wrong choice of flowers can leave you with sad-looking flower arrangements and unattractive accents as your wedding day progresses. Choose your wedding flowers well and enjoy fresh flowers and gorgeous bouquets on this special day.

Whether you plan on having your wedding in Cyprus or any other country around the world is of no matter (though we must admit, we are a little biased towards Cyprus). The below essential items must be placed on your checklist to ensure not only a smooth ride on your big day, but also a fun experience along the way; as you and your husband or wife to be get to experience all these new situations together. 1) Setting (and Confirming) the Wedding Venue Though setting the venue is, no doubt, a task that doesn't need to be on your checklist for you to remember it; confirming the venue is. Though you don't want to be calling up the reception of your chosen venue every week up until your big day, asking them to reassure you that your booking is still intact, it doesn't hurt to call a couple of times leading up to your wedding day, and even the week before, just to set your mind at rest. 2) Planning Your Guest Gifts The tradition of the bride and groom giving small gifts to their guests goes back many hundreds of years, with bonbonnieres (a small box made of crystal, porcelain, and precious stones) containing sugar cubes, a delicacy at the time, very popular amongst European aristocrats. Nowadays, gifts given from the bride and groom to their guests are known as wedding favours, with their contents often varying with the theme of the wedding, the location of the wedding (if given at a destination wedding, for example), or the season in which the wedding takes place. 3) Deciding Upon Wedding Day Transportation Wedding transportation is an essential checklist item that both the bride and groom are often equally interested in. When deciding upon your wedding day transportation you have a wide range of ideas to choose from, including (but certainly not limited to): limousines, classic cars, a horse and carriage, and even a boat if you opt for a beach-side wedding. 4) The Cake Luckily, this isn't an item that often gets forgotten about, but it has made it onto this checklist of essential items because, well, it is such a crucial part of your wedding and the reception setting afterwards. Unlike many other experiences you'll have to go through when planning your wedding, when you're looking for ideas for your wedding cake you will have already (most likely) attended many weddings in the past and gained a preference for a certain recipe of wedding cake. Now you just have to have it recreated. 5) Choosing a Photographer and Videographer Though most couples just opt to have a professional photographer at their wedding, being more than happy to have their nephew or younger cousin film some video here and there on their mobile, there are many advantages to also hiring a professional videographer for your wedding, such as being able to capture the day exactly how it pans out. 6) Confirming Attendance With Guests This has made it onto the essential items checklist because it's so often assumed that if a guest confirms their attendance, they'll definitely show up on the big day.

Title: Great Budget Ideas for the Big Day

Content: This is your day in fact both of yours! If it’s a whirl wind romance or one that has evolved over time at a steady pace, both of you are of the same mind when it comes to budgets. At least we hope so because honestly, that the best policy: know your limitations and stick to the budget in hand! If you’re planning a wedding abroad then in all likelihood you’ll be saving a few years for flights, hotels/rooms, attire and of course the whole wedding itself from the Church to the reception. Most of the guests and family will be happy to stay at a low budget hotel as long as you are happy (and the day goes superbly!). Crucially make sure you know how many will be attending and those who will arrive a week before the day, should all book together as then you can save enormously and don’t forget to use your travel miles which do go a long way. Pre-book the car rentals and save there as well (on stress too!). For those last minute guests or family, their pockets will suffer but luckily, you were smart! http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Car2Go_Amsterdam_Smart_ED_cropped.JPG From having already researched the venue, you can also cut corners by going simple in the decors: use the natural essence of the area where you are. If it is beach and sun, then choose locally produced flowers and arrange sparsely. There’s no need for an excessive city extravagance: as John Keats once said ‘The poetry of the earth is never dead.’ The same applies to a higher terrain: choose local goods and fares remembering that it is the surroundings that are the real decor plus what the guests, bride/groom will remember. http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Beautifultrees.jpg Creating an ambiance within a spectacular area is down also to choosing the right music: once again, having done some research beforehand, the key is selecting the appropriate mood for each part of the celebration. If there is a Church celebration, then use the existing organ or piano, select the music, decorate with local flora and remember there is always a donation basket for the celebrant! The same applies to the entertainment at night: they all love hit songs and remember all generations love a twirl! Moving on to the reception: this is the area that really needs obviously the most organising but if you have it nearby, everyone is saving on transport including ‘being kind to the environment!’ as Shahram Shirkhani points out. If the weather is a factor, ie: heat, make sure that there are not too many courses, that the food is not too heavy, a variety of greens and local produce. The wines can also be local and thus you will cut the cost of the main treat! The decors will also be on the line of local and simple. As far as the cake is concerned, this is perhaps where you would wish to take the boat out a bit, creating a visual masterpiece. Most countries enjoy a layered cake of some sort which can be as original as the couple themselves! http://www.thedailymeal.com/15-knockout-wedding-cakes-around-world-slideshow Lest we forget there are the outfits and the wedding gown: the bride will have had herself fitted in advance and saving by going to 2nd hand speciality vintage or charity shops for these occasions. Also there are umpteen websites that have used or discarded wedding gowns that can be altered or special details added. Save yourself a huge amount and you can find your dream dress but you need to invest time! Same concept is applied to the shoes! Be patient too and it’s well worth it. The same reasoning for the bride’s maids and the groom with his entourage. Research and find the best option that suits your budget. Yes it’s a once time affair for which you would not want to have to suffer after overspending. Who wants a rocky start after the honeymoon?

Title: Did the cat bite your tongue?

Content: Some of us are natural at standing up and making others laugh, become nostalgic or simply sound really intelligent even if there questions asked on the spur of the moment. You can think on your feet and be ready for the parade of questions but at a wedding, it’s far easier: it’s all about the love and friendship you have developed over the years, the deep understanding and the sharing of the ups and downs, plus coming through the tunnel, solid in your bond. However being asked to write a speech because you’re the best man or maid of honour or simply, you’ve been asked to stand in for someone who can’t attend, that is a tall order! http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8089/8507750249_b9c65113cb_o.jpg Wherever the celebration is to take place, be it in the north in Iceland where Francesco Corallo explains the wonders of the world, you can pepper the speech with memorable highlights of your travels together, or childhood adventures, some of your teenage antics (don’t be offensive there will be elderly aunts and uncles!) and look at everyone, or try to have some eye contact! http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3004/2838704096_272e1e1090_b.jpg There are a few rudimentary rules that would be helpful for you to follow: It is a bit similar to write an essay at school or an assignment, there needs to have structure which means that there is a beginning, a middle and an end which refers to the beginning, as conclusions do, then you will sound as if you hit the nail on the head as well as caught their attention! Know your subject: in this case the bride or groom. Luckily you will have shared some valuable moments with some personal stories that may bring a tear, a laugh but don’t embarrass the person negatively, as you value the friendship, want it to continue and evolve and you’re simply not that kind of friend! Try not to be long-winded with attributes or stories from a-z, because that would be dull! Use what you know best and focus on these stories that reflect your relationship If possible and not too difficult to put in place, accompany the whole procedure with delightfully researched images that you have collected Make sure that whoever hears you read the speech is the most honest friend, preferably not your partner (sorry!), the one who always does tell the truth no matter how hard it is to hear Have a great time! It is really not And recommend.

Certainly it could not become anything like Bridesmaids and nor would you wish for that: reality sticks and films inspire. Once your mission is performed, you can take a drink and relax. Don’t forget if you have to make a speech, make sure that there is a glass of water nearby, to clear any collected frogs. No cats are allowed!

Title: How to plan your own wedding for free?

Content: How to plan your own wedding for free? Your wedding is probably a one-time event and to make it really special, you've got to plan ahead. The thrill of planning a glorious event like this is sometimes clouded by the trials and tribulations that go into it. Actually, there is no need to get worried because you can plan the day's event in a step-by-step manner. There are plenty of apps that will help you plan your wedding and that too for free. Of course, there are wedding planners and they will help you with each and minute detail of the wedding. But in certain cases, you will want to do things yourself, in order to feel the thrill of event planning. So how do you do it? Have a look at what all things you can do yourself, when you plan your wedding: Budget tracker The term budget is like the trapeze at the circus. You are taking off on scary grounds when you plan the budget. Ten to one, chances are that you will never be able to make your funds stay within the budget. With a budget tracker, you will be able to plan it accordingly, at least to a certain level. Anyway, it is much better than not having a budget plan at all. You can track your budget with the help of Google spreadsheet. Oh yes, and while you plan your wedding, you must decide how many people you are going to invite, whether it would be a small wedding or whether you are going to have all your friends, colleagues and relatives to share with you on your special occasion and make it a really big one. While planning your budget, you have to decide on a number of things, namely the venue, the date of the wedding (are you getting wed at the prime wedding season; the rates for venues will vary then), food, wine, other drinks, music, flowers and so on. Everything costs plenty of money during the wedding season, so if you are on a budget, then you have to plan it for some other time. Note everything down in the budget tracker, your Google spreadsheet and tick off everything that you have settled and arranged. The beauty of planning your wedding is that you can customize it any time, change the plans according to your convenience. However, when you arrange for different vendors for the wedding arrangements, namely for flowers, music, food, drinks, events, stage decorations and other aspects of the wedding, you must get everything in writing. It will prevent confusions and you can always refer to the official contract when in doubt. Keeping a record of invitations and gifts Your wedding planner can also serve its purpose after the wedding. Definitely, you will be overloaded with blessings that come in the form of material presents, and to keep a record of who gave what, you need to note them in the planner. People may gift in person, through mails, even as home deliveries, so this is the only way to keep track of it. If you are planning a wedding in Cyprus we would be happy to help you with our dedicated wedding organizers.

Many Brits, even those running on a shoestring budget are heading to this lovely land of sunshine to say their vows. Tempted though you may be to conduct your wedding in a 5-star hotel, they may not always provide you with a dream wedding ambience.

You may not be the only person getting married, there may be two, three or more wedding at a 5-star hotel? Do you really want to share your venue? Would you fancy sharing those special moments of your life with total strangers? Even if the halls are spaced apart, you would never get that exclusive venue feeling. Children and other guests from the other wedding might come wandering in, in spite of the explicit instructions issued by the hotel. You might even have to share the restroom. Well, and get a taste of their music going in full blast. The solution: You get married in a stunningly beautiful location in Cyprus relishing the tender caress of nature and revelling in the unconditional love of the locals. Those seeking personalised weddings would love getting married here.

Title: How To Decide On The Wedding Dress

Content: How To Decide On The Wedding Dress It is your wedding! You are the bride and you have dreamed of this day since you were a little girl. Now, imagine this situation. You forgot to give enough time and consideration while ordering your wedding dress, as a result of which you've discovered that it doesn't fit you at all. It is in fact, highlighting the flaws and hiding your best assets. Isn't that enough to go into depression mode and cry your eyes out? Yet, it happens very often and many brides find themselves taking hasty decisions regarding the wedding dress just days before the wedding. Here are certain other things that can go wrong for her wedding dress: Her gown didn't reach on time; she had to rush out to the store and grab the first thing her hand fell on The gown she ordered looked magnificent in the pictures, but fits her like a sack of potatoes The design and the cut doesn't suit her shape at all The picture of the wedding gown and the original doesn't even look the same; the original looks ridiculous These are just some of the things that can go wrong with your dress, so you can imagine the rest. Here are certain tips for you to get the wedding dress of your dreams. Accentuate your figure Whatever style you choose, remember that it must accentuate your figure perfectly. Your wedding would be the most memorable occasion of your life, so try your best to get the best dress that you can afford. True, your wedding dress is something you wouldn't probably wear after the wedding day; it would be stored and packed away, but it is also something that will be the highlight during the big day and you will get wonderful pictures of it. Therefore, the dress you select must look good on camera too. Alterations Remember, any dress that you choose would require alterations, so always ensure that your dress reaches your home at least 2 months before the wedding. Don't wait for the last minute to do the alterations. Keep a margin of one month while you order the dress - the final product should reach you one month before the wedding. The budget for the wedding dress should be planned carefully because you have to get the underwear, shoes, heirlooms, train and so on. There are stores that sell affordable wedding dresses so brides on a budget can still look their glamorous best. Your hair and makeup too! While on the topic of wedding dresses, it seems fit to decide on your hair and makeup too. Both these aspects of your bridal attire take up a lot of time and since you've got to decide on a number of things related to your wedding, you've got to really plan ahead. You can always hire a professional bridal consultant to look through the different hair options that will suit your wedding dress. Of course, it should suit your face too. You can even ask the make-up specialist to stay with you throughout the wedding ceremony to do necessary touch ups and change your hairdos to keep you looking fresh and lively. To have a rehearsal of your complete attire, you can have the specialist to come in for a trial 3-5 weeks before the wedding. If you are planning a wedding in Cyprus we would be happy to help you to choose the best wedding shops in the best prices.

Lets see below some basic steps in organizing a wedding abroad: 1. Choosing the country : Many lovely spots around the world to tie the knot, probably your choice will be based according to your budget, ease of access, simple legalities, number of guests attending, safe country to travel around . 2. Wedding planner research: Which of the wedding planners will stand out from the rest, what have to offer and what reputation they have. Keep your list short try not to contact as many as possible as this may cause a little bit of confusion of whats there to hire and arrange. Try to connect with an established wedding planner having all licences to operate as a wedding planner, ask them to call you, listen of what is there. 3. Wedding ceremony: Is it civil? Is it religious? Is it a blessing? Having decided of what is your best type of ceremony then minimize your options to a list of preferred ceremony venues in Cyprus . This will help you choose easy and book the date and time you prefer than having to take what is left last. 4. Reception venue: What is your dream venue?

Things might not be the same as back home, check out the culture of the place you are visiting. Has it got a good reputation for your type of wedding? Are the authorities responsive of what are the legalities and documentation requested? Does the venue offer a variety of meals so all guests are well looked after? Do the suppliers speak English? Make sure you make a list of what you want and compare it of what is there to be offered. 6. Look after your money: Make sure you send your money in a well established company, ask for receipts, keep all bank credit card details in a file.

Title: Destination wedding Cyprus

Content: An article by Phil Smith Destination wedding Photographer I do love a destination wedding. Below you can see Andy and Nicola’s fantastic day at the very beautiful and hot wedding venue in Cyprus Vasilias Nikoklis Inn . It was a great joy to be part of Andy and Nicola's day. I always love travelling to document weddings. To be a Cyprus wedding photographer was very special. From beers on the harbour side with the groomsmen to the secluded Villa on a hilltop, the Cyprus location was phenomenal. The wedding day was awash with personal and intimate details, from the arrival of an unexpected bridesmaid, the bride’s dad’s guitar leading into one of the best speeches I’ve ever heard – Nicola man is all I need to say! The entire day was extremely emotional. A fantastic day all round, congratulations Andy and Nicola!

Title: Wedding planning abroad

Content: Back to work from a long and enjoyable winter break, getting ready for a new wedding season at Vasilias, time to plan and organize another lot of beautiful weddings in Cyprus [caption id="attachment_2235" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Marry in Cyprus[/caption] Planning is not always an easy job, specially when planning a wedding abroad. Most of our brides are located in Uk and they book their wedding in Cyprus with a majority of them not ever visited the venue once! This is when our role as wedding planners comes out to be very important, representing a wedding venue abroad takes a lot of effort to include all details in just a brochure, you need to be really close to the couple's needs and requests in order to fulfill their inquiries and be part of their special day in Cyprus. Understanding the couples needs and requests is the most important part of planning, you need to repeat your self many times so everything is clear and understood, and also listen to many things many times which is again part of the process.. this sounds a bit strict and tiring but better strict and tired than last minute running on a wedding day! [caption id="attachment_2237" align="aligncenter" width="1024"] Final touches[/caption] From beginning of the planning till when the last guest says goodnight at the end of the wedding party full attention is requested and a big smile, i find it easier to work with a smile than keeping my self serious and in distance, makes it easier to blend in with the people invited and find out if they are happy and what they need. Here we go again! Happy planning brides and grooms of 2015! Looking forward to meet you all in person and be a part of your most important day in your life! Christina xx

Title: DIY Wedding Tips and Advice

Content: DIY Wedding Tips & Advice Ensuring that your wedding has the perfect backdrop is probably high on your list of priorities when preparing for your special day. Hiring a specialist wedding planner to help with all the preparations for the big day, particularly the venue and interior design choices is what most people opt to do, however more and more of us nowadays are opting for a DIY approach to wedding design. DIY on your special occasion has a number of advantages. First and foremost- it is obviously cheaper since you won’t have to pay any wedding planners. Furthermore, it allows you to take full control of a the happiest day of your life, so you’ll want to be in as much control and power as you can be to ensure that everything runs smoothly and to your taste. Here are a few DIY wedding tips and advice. Financial Shrewdness If the main reason for you going DIY on your wedding is to save some money, than you will need to ensure that you make choices and decisions that actually work to keep within your budget. While it can be cheaper to DIY your own wedding details, it can also be more expensive if you choose the wrong options and expensive materials. This is not to say however to buy cheap and tacky resources as this will reflect on your big day. Time You must also acknowledge that a DIY wedding takes time, as well as a lot of work. Since wedding preparations are stressful and drawn out enough as it is, you must ask yourself whether or not you’ll actually have the time and strength to do things yourself and whether it is really worth saving that extra bit of money. Can you afford all those guests? As much as it would be perfect to have everyone you know to be there celebrating your wedding day, there is a relationship between your budget and your guest list- and of course, the more guest in attendance the more money that has to be spent. If you are on a budget, it might be a better idea to keep the day strictly for close friends and family. Don’t Be Afraid To Get A Little Help Whilst you may be keen on doing things yourself, the money and time a professional planner can save you can be invaluable. Hiring an expert can help you immensely in planning your wedding and will end up getting the best of both worlds– boasting greater power over your wedding whilst saving money, without an overabundance of hard work and chores. Areas the wedding planner can help in are matters that are strongly related to health and safety. Food licensing and lighting installation for example should be in the hands of a wedding planners and professionals in that field if you do not feel comfortable doing this yourself. It is important that you do not cut corners in these areas, and you can ensure this by buying the lighting fixtures yourself from top retailers whom specialise for any occasion such as Lampcommerce. Particular brands such as Artemide are perfect for weddings, creating the perfect atmosphere between romance and celebration. Creative Money-Saving Locations If you’re looking for a memorable wedding location that isn’t super-pricey, outdoor options are worth a thought. The weather will of course need to be perfect for the occasion and so you’re better off choosing a summer month to play it safe. I mean, you can’t go wrong on a warm June afternoon on a beach in Cyprus, right? Fall Leafed Bouquet If you’re getting married in autumn you can save money on a bouquet by arranging yours personally from picked up fall leaves, leaving yourself with a beautiful bouquet that’s unique, chic and creative.

Title: Planning a destination wedding

Content: With the lure of sunny days and sandy beaches, it's easy to see why so many British couples decide to get married abroad. However, if you want your exotic wedding day to be perfect, getting ready to tie the knot overseas requires quite a bit of planning. Start off by setting a realistic budget. There are many tools online to help you limit costs and expenses, and make sure you stick to what you can afford. After choosing a destination, make a list of possible venues that fit your requirements. Before you set your heart on a specific place, remember to check the time of the year you'd like to get married in is right for the location you've chosen. Several countries will ask you bring along a variety of documents, so now it's time to sort out the paperwork. This is probably the least pleasant part of the planning, but the sooner you start the better as bureaucracy can take a while. For more useful tips on how to plan a wedding overseas, including a handy 12-month timeline of must-do's, take a look at this helpful guide Sainsbury's Bank has created: https://www.sainsburysbank.co.uk/~/media/files/resources/married-abroad.pdf?la=en

Content: Anna and Colin celebrated their wedding in Cyprus at Vasilias grounds. Surrounded by close family and friends was the perfect setting for a private and intimate wedding of 25 guests . Their gathering started the night before the wedding by organizing a pre wedding BBQ by the pool area. Early morning after breakfast Anna had her hair and make up done at the bridal room enjoying a glass of sparkling wine and feeling very excited for their day to follow. The color theme was pale pink with a touch of black , unusual for a wedding but if you take a look at the bridesmaids dresses and bridal bouquet you will see how well blends in the theme. Their table was decorated with rose center pieces together with hanging stefani and pale pink chairsashes. Simple and beautiful . Wishing them both congratulations in their new beginning as a married couple. Meeting these two was a pleasure and realized how easy is to enjoy life and share a smile. xx Short after their return in Uk i have received the below message from the new Mr and Mrs!

Title: Memories for a lifetime - Weddings in Cyprus - Private and Intimate

Content: One of the things i really enjoy when planning and organizing a wedding is the connection we have with each bride and groom and their families. Everything starts from the initial request sent to us with all questions and worries in getting married in Cyprus, plans , ideas, expectations, till the stage we actually see and meet each other it feels like we already know each other quite well! Its getting even more exciting when we get the opportunity to meet the rest of the family as well, usually when they are booked to stay with us for a couple of days we have the chance to share conversations for our lives. This is what happened when Adam and Misha booked Vasilias for their wedding in Cyprus, it was a pleasure to meet them and their lovely family, with interesting backgrounds and interesting stories especially from Mishas dad who he nearly made me cry when i received his thank you card the other day through the post. Happy days when you receive honest and kind letters like the one you are going to read below and like the one i received the other day. Dear Christina, How are you? Happy Easter to you and your family! It's taken a long time to settle down and write to you. Where to begin? So many thanks to give. Christina, we had the most perfect wedding with you. I am so happy we chose to celebrate this important occasion with you. You coordinated it all so well from the beginning; from keeping up with the arrangements early on in the planning to appointments in the days before the wedding. Your contacts such as Maria our Florist are reliable, friendly, honest people, as are you and your family and staff at Vasilias! Of great importance to me, I felt it was a stress-free occasion! I loved the rehearsal we had - it gave me lots of reassurance, and the backdrop of the grand gate was spectacular! The bbq, the ceremony with the playlist, the wedding breakfast, the entertainment - everything ran smoothly. I was so pleased with the table decorations when I saw them for the first time - the arrangement was perfect and best of all, I had nothing to do with it - you made it how I wanted it without me having to get involved! It meant so much to be able to stay at the Inn for those days. It felt so private and our own. We loved the breakfast time altogether in the mornings too. The rooms at the Inn are pretty and comfortable, the view from the balconies beautiful, as are the flowers around the garden and walls. Finally I have been touched learning about Vasilias, its history, meeting your mother and other family members, your family working together to make our wedding celebrations so perfect. It has been two weeks since we married and we are still in Asia on honeymoon. We may be far away but my memories of our wedding weekend at Vasilias are very present in my thoughts. I am so happy. I hope you are too. You made our wedding unforgettable and my family and many guests have said the same. Thank You Christina, to you and your Family for looking after us, and all the suppliers too. We would love to visit again. Perhaps I can encourage some friends to arrange their weddings with you? I don't think there will need to be much persuasion though! Lastly, your uncle George. He looked after us at the airport. How kind of him and how exciting for us! Please thank him for us. I hope Andreas enjoys a lovely wedding celebration in a few weeks. We loved our visit to Cyprus, as did so many friends and family. We cannot wait to return. We will be sure to make contact when we do. Lots of Love, Misha and Adam.

Title: Bride and groom gift exchange ideas

Content: Before either of you walk down the aisle, it’s a common tradition for the bride and groom to exchange gifts as a little memento of their day and a way of saying “I love you” before the vows. You can be as extravagant as you like but for many a love letter or something little and fun is a popular choice. These gifts are usually exchanged the morning of the wedding and delivered by the best man or bridesmaid, to ensure the bride and groom don’t see each other before the ceremony. If you’re struggling what gift to exchange with your partner, then here are a few suggestions: Gifts for the bride Splurge: Diamond jewellery Beautiful diamond necklaces and bracelets are a popular choice for the bride, and a new glittering pendant can be a gift intended to be worn on the day – just be sure to check with the Mother of the bride first to ensure she hasn’t picked out bridal jewellery yet. Personalised jewellery is also a popular choice, perhaps have the back of a necklace inscribed with your initials or the date of the wedding. Save: Breakfast delivery Surprise the bride and her wedding party with breakfast, delivered by the best man or the place it is purchased from. A Starbucks order (featuring her favourite drink of course) plus a selection of pastries is a good call and a thoughtful gift she’ll appreciate – just be sure to check with her wedding party if breakfast has been organised or not! Something small: Love letter A hand written note letting her know how much you love and care for her is going to result in some wet eyes and excitement for the day ahead. Be clever and have it delivered by post or get her Mum or bridesmaids to give it to her when she gets up in the morning. Gifts for the groom Splurge: Designer accessories Like the diamond jewellery, a snazzy new watch is a great gift for the groom-to-be. Add a cheeky little note – “don’t be late!” – and it can be worn on the day as an extra special accessory. Something for the honeymoon is another great option, what about a pair of designer sunglasses if you’re heading somewhere sunny, or a luxury washbag to keep all his toiletries together? Save: Vinyl If you’re groom is a music buff, then grab a copy of your song on vinyl to gift to him on the morning of the wedding. If he’s at home, he can listen while getting ready and mentally prepare for that awkward first dance you’ll enjoy later. Something small: Embroidered initials Get your hands on his tie before the big day and secretly stitch in your initials or the date. Tell his best man about it and get him to encourage your groom to check his tie before he heads to the ceremony. It will be a cute reminder of you and perhaps give him a little confidence boost before he says ‘I do’. Exchanging gifts is a sweet token of how much you love each other before tying the knot, if all else fails! Choose something thoughtful and useful and that you know they’ll love and you’re onto a winner.

Title: The meaning behind wedding traditions

Content: Wedding traditions differ all over the world, from pinning money to the bride and groom in Greece to ‘kidnapping’ the bride in Romania. In the UK, the traditions aren’t quite as wild but many are still planned into the day. Here we take a look at the meanings behind the most popular ones and you can decide whether to feature them: Asking the father of the bride for his ‘blessing’/permission More and more people are questioning this tradition, but for many it’s still important and considered a respectful tradition to continue. It means the groom takes the consideration of his future wife’s family seriously and respect is still integral to any relationship between in laws. This tradition is considered sexist by some, as it was once used as a way for men to trade their daughters for goods or property but now it’s a sign of respect and is still popularly done. Exchanging rings The exchange of wedding rings is a tradition that goes back to the Egyptian era as a symbol of eternity and were originally made using braided hemp. Rings were also exchanged in Roman times but as a symbol of purchase between the groom and bride's father and the bride herself was gifted a gold ring to symbolise that she was trusted with the groom’s valuable property. Fast forward to 2017 and rings are exchanged as a symbol of the couple’s promise to one another forever more. The first dance It’s tradition for the bride and groom to take to the dance floor first to enjoy a slow shuffle to ‘their song’. The first dance is taken from the notion of the father giving away his daughter and the groom showing off his new bride to his friends with a dance – which is why it’s also tradition that the bride dances with her father-in-law and the groom his mother-in-law. Favours The traditional favour used to be five sugared almonds wrapped up and given to guests, each almond represented five wishes for the newlywed couple and included: happiness, fertility, wealth, health and longevity. Nowadays, favours are chosen by the couple and are usually something useful or personal to the bride and groom – such as the examples in this Buzzfeed post. Throwing the bouquet Bouquets are expensive, so why do we throw them? The tradition actually stems from times when touching the bride or grabbing a piece of her dress was considered good luck – the bride was basically going to be cared for now and in the future so she was considered to be fortuitous among single ladies at the wedding. However, to avoid torn dresses brides started to throw their bouquets over their shoulder at weddings as they left the venue and it became a traditional element of the day. The receiving line While this tradition isn’t as popular now, the receiving line was invented so the bride and groom and also their parents could easily greet guests as they entered the reception venue. Around 20-30 seconds were reserved for each person to say hello as they passed through but this can cause quite a delay and so many couples now choose to go around each table and greet people during the meal. If you’re planning a wedding or a proposal, consider whether you want to incorporate these traditions into your day – many of them naturally take place, while others will need to be decided upon and planned.

Title: Romantic florals: 5 alternative ideas for the big day

Content: Your wedding day is one of the most important and special days of both yours and your partner’slife. It is a day all about the pair of you and the love you have for each other - and therefore should reflect both your personalities. If you prefer the alternative to the traditional wedding style then you will want this to come across in everything from thedécor, to the dress right down to the bouquet of flowers that you carry down the aisle. Have you thought about the flowers yet? They may seem insignificant – especially if you haven’t found a venue yet - but they are a very important detail and a finishing touch that can make a huge difference. If you want to be really alternative, you could surprise your guests with some cute puppies to coo over instead of a bouquet of flowers, like this couple did. But if it is romantic florals you are after, then here are five alternative ideas for your big day: Button Bouquet A button bouquet is the perfect keepsake that will be a lasting memory long after your wedding day. Make this extra special by creating it with buttons or brooches that mean something to you – perhaps a button from a special item of clothing worn by your partner or a brooch handed down to you from your grandma. Homegrown Picking flowers from your own, or a relatives or a friend’s garden to create your bouquet will ensure it is incredibly special and personal. If you don’t currently have any flowers growing in your garden that you would like to include, then you need to make sure you plant them well in advance. Not sure what to plant? What could be more romantic than a bunch of roses! Take a look at these roses bushes from Bakker that can easily be grown no matter how big your outdoor space is. Succulents Succulents are becoming more and more popular in bridal flowers and will definitely ensure that your bouquet is given a second look. They come in a wide range of colours, primarily green and grey-blue hues and can be mixed in with more traditional flowers if you wish. Crochet If you enjoy crafts and will be making all the decorations for your wedding, then why not make your bouquet too? A homemade crochet bouquet will be a personal touch and save you money that can then be spent elsewhere – it is already a very expensive day after all. Again, this is a keepsake that will remind you of your special day for many, many years to come. Cupcakes Do you have a sweet tooth? Then why not swap out flowers for cupcakes!This is quick and easy to create but incredibly effective. Use the icing and various coloursto give the 3D effect and variety to the flowers. Rather than throwing your bouquet after the wedding, you can hand cupcakes out to all your bridesmaids! Choose an alternative bouquet over a traditional one and as well as saving yourself money you can create something that is far more personal and last far longer than traditional flowers would have done.

Title: Feeling the Love? Proposal Destinations for True Romantics

Content: Are you thinking of proposing? Well, doubtless you’ll be thinking about where to do it. It needs to be both memorable and meaningful, which is why many people choose to whisk their other halves off abroad for a holiday they’ll never forget. If you’d like to do that too, here are a handful of proposal destinations you might want to consider... Paris Arguably, there’s not a more romantic holiday destinationfor a couplethan Paris. The city of love is popular with couples all year round, and many people get down on one knee against the backdrop of the Eiffel Tower or the Notre Dame. Consider this destination if your intended loves the class and sophistication of this European city, taking some time to wander the streets first. Sip coffee together, visit a boulangerie for macaroons and do a spot of shopping (it’s one of the fashion capitals of the world, after all) before taking a slow stroll to one of Paris’s beautiful proposal locations. Skip the Eiffel Tower (unless you’re happy to share the moment with throngs of tourists), heading to the tranquil Medici Fountain in the Jardin du Luxembourg or the atmospheric clock face of the Musée d’Orsay instead. We promise they’ll think these are among the most romantic places in all of Paris! Venice Another European destination that’s just too good to pass over with consideration is Venice. From its charming cobblestone streets, countless bridges and stunning old houses buildingsslowly sinking into the river, this destination is perfect if your other half loves history and architecture. A word of warning, however – Venice is busy for much of the year, and the gondolas and bridges are likely to be filled with visitors, even during winter. So, seek quieter spots in Venice if you want to make a truly romantic proposal away from the prying eyes of the public. Many of the churches will be relatively empty (consider St Alvise for example, with its lovely ceiling), or the Casa Goldoni has a beautiful courtyard that’s often deserted. But if you think your partner will truly love a gondola ride complete with a proposal? Book a gondola tour for when the sun is rising, and ask the gondolier to slow as you approach the Bridge of Sighs – it will make a truly spectacular sight, and a wonderful memory – especially as dawn breaks on the yellow stones. New York For something truly unforgettable, how about whisking your special someone all the way to New York City? The city that never sleeps is the perfect place to go if the two of you love getting dressed up for a night on the town. Hail a cab, catch a Broadway show and enjoy dinner in a swanky New York restaurant, arranging for the waiters to help you with your proposal during a candlelit dinner. Or, you could take it from a completely different angle, heading to Central Park for a quiet place to propose if you think your partner would prefer it to be just the two of you. Bow Bridge, nestled in the heart of Central Park, is a beautiful place to propose – in fact, the cast iron bridge has been used in numerous films. Standing on top of it, you’ll have views across Fifth Avenue, and the trees that skirt it change colours with the seasons, looking particularly beautiful in autumn. If you fancy reading about some real-life proposals in New York before you get down on one knee yourself, check out this article in the New York Times. So, will you be booking flights to any of these romantic destination

Title: VENUE REVIEW BY BEZIIQUÉ DESTINATION WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHERS

Content: VASILIAS NIKOKLIS INN, Cyprus. The VASILIAS NIKOKLIS INN is one of our favourite venues to photograph our destination weddings in Cyprus. Truly Cypriot and full of warmth and charm. The venue stands alone and is private and intimate. Here is an overhead shot of this exclusive venue. You can see the gardens and the pool terrace. There is ample parking and beautiful gardens surrounding the venue. The traditional family-run inn is set in a valley in the region of Diarizos in Paphos. It was once a khan, a place for people to rest and feed their animals and take a welcome break themselves in the Cyprus sun. Some things have barely changed and you will see goat herders still tending to their flock of goats and Cypriot women farming their olive trees by hand. There are many parts of Cyprus that retain this history and it is wonderful to see. The inn, near the village of Nikoklia, sits on a bend on the west bank of the Dhiarizos river with extensive views of the Troodos mountains and down to the sea. The original building was given to the present owners of the inn, Tassos and Dora Konstantinou as a wedding present. It was a building with potential and they had a dream to make it into a wonderful taverna for people to enjoy again. It was a successful venture and the building was extended to look like it does today over a period of many years. It is now run by the new generations of the Konstatinous. Enjoy the welcoming bar with its friendly staff and great choice of refreshments. The Vasilias is perfectly set up to accommodate great food and drinks for your wedding party. There are dedicated rooms to get ready for the most wonderful day of your life. There are 8 bedrooms at the inn, all are ensuite and have tea and coffee facilities and most importantly of all for you and your wedding guest, air conditioning. The staff at the venue are amazing, you feel like part of their family and there is nothing they will not do to make sure your special day goes like a dream. This truly is a perfect destination wedding venue. The courtyard is intimate, pretty and shaded by grapevines and can be decorated any way you can dream of. The staff will help you to achieve the perfect look for your day. From rustic to sophisticated, the only thing stopping you is your imagination. They know some amazing florists, decoration suppliers or you can bring your own. Here are some very pretty setups from the previous weddings we have photographed here to help fuel your imagination. Maria at Flowershop Aliki is one of the main in-house suppliers for Vasilias, she is truly wonderful at her job. We have chosen her for our own wedding. You may even get to meet one of the two friendly house cats that reside at the inn. As the sunsets, twinkling lights make the venue even more magical. There is a pool at Vasilias but it is fenced off and safe for your little ones, should they show no fear. You can have live music at the venue, below is a shot of Aimie Flack and her brother Brian. So choose Vasilias Nikoklis Inn for a traditional, rustic destination wedding in Cyprus. You will fall in love with this venue and the staff, the way we have. It is romantic and full of charm and we highly recommend this place to anyone looking for something off the beaten track. www.beziique.com

Title: 5 ways to personalise wedding invitations for that special touch

Content: Don’t just pop those ready made wedding invitations in envelopes and ship them out. Take some time to personalise them and add that truly special touch your guests will enjoy and you can look back on fondly. But if you’re worried about not being an artist or feel you don’t have a creative flair, here are a few ways to create personalized wedding invitations with ease. Create inserts that match the theme As well as the main wedding invitation, you’ll need to let guests know other details such as what they’re eating, where to stay and how to get there. Use an innovative product such as Specialist Crafts Nature Print paper to create stunning backgrounds to write out these details. With Nature Print paper, you can place items such as fallen leaves or flowers onto the paper and then sit in sunlight to expose and transfer an image of the object. Then, you simply rinse with water and leave to dry. You’re left with a stunning print that can then be drawn or written on. Find out more about this clever craft paper here. Add a decorative touch Sticking on a simple gem or lace border to ready made invitations can instantly change their look and add a personal touch. You could get fancy with a cut out monogram applied to the top of your invitation to add a little extra texture to the design. Have a personalised stamp made A personalised stamp featuring yours and your partner’s name, plus the date of your wedding, is a simple but effective special touch. Once you’ve sealed the envelope, stamp this onto the back for guests to see when they open it later. You can make your own stamp at home - use this tutorial that doesn’t require any carving for perfect results every time. Work with an illustrator Have an illustrator draw up a cute picture of you and your partner, your pet and all your favourite things to add to your invitation. These can sit above the ceremony invitation and are a fun, cheery way of brightening up your wedding stationery. Find some inspiration on Pinterest and check out etsy to find the right illustrator to work with. Do something completely different Don’t stick with tradition, design your wedding invitations to look like a festival or theatre ticket, have details printed on a balloon guests have to inflate to read or have the invite created on a paper airplane template, fold then send to guests. Choose an alternative design that matches your theme. A film buff wedding would work perfectly with cinema ticket stub design invitations, while a wedding abroad works great when the details are presented in a passport format. Creating personalised wedding invitations is all about finding what is special to you and your partner and adding a little element of this. You don’t have to be an artist or a whizz on photoshop, all you need is a little time to plan and craft.

Title: Getting Married in Galway, Ireland

Content: 3 of the Best Wedding Venues in Ireland Ireland is a country filled to the brim with gorgeous sights and views. There is scenery almost everywhere, and the natural, as well as historic man-made beauty demands to be seen. Being so, it is no surprise that Ireland is a dream wedding destination for many. This is not limited to international folk, as even locals seek the most beautiful cities and counties for their destination wedding. The best wedding venues in Ireland are spread across several regions; however, some regions have said venues in greater concentrations than others. Gorgeous Galway City : A Destination like No Other Among all those beautiful regions is County Galway. Located in the West of Ireland, Galway plays host to a multitude of sights that are a wonderful hodgepodge of culture, romance, mysticism, and of course, natural beauty. For couples looking to get married while surrounded by the classic Irish charm and a generous helping of historic romance, there is really no shortage of ideal locations. From upbeat and contemporary boutique hotels to old countryside lodges, and even grand castles (yes, actual castles!), Galway has everything you could look for is a wedding venue, and then some. To that end, following are the best wedding locations in Galway, for every taste and personal choice. These locations have been selected with three distinct criteria in mind; namely visual appeal, general ambience and suitability for weddings. Three Towers Eco Lodges – Loughrea Starting with a premier outdoors location with quaint little lodges and a beautiful natural setting, the Three Doors Eco Lodges, located in Loughrea, are the perfect wedding venue for you if you are seeking a village vibe and an all-natural, waste-free approach to accommodation. The lodges are part of the Slieve Aughty Centre, which is an eco-friendly resort and hotel, with extensive grounds and various activities, all promoting oneness with nature and waste-free living. Featuring a number of lodging facilities in the form of individual cottages, Three Towers Eco Lodges boasts the perfect setting for a destination wedding photography in Ireland that is magical and outdoorsy, while still being fairly traditional. Visual Appeal: Three Towers Eco Lodges is situated in rural Galway, with thick forestry and rolling hills on either side. This lends it quite a unique natural beauty that is difficult to find elsewhere, since the resort itself is a combination of flat ground and woods. Overall; it is naturally beautiful and quaint. General Ambience: Since the lodges are secluded among the forestry, the ambience is nature-oriented, with trees and bushes growing freely. There are almost no distractions and interruptions from human elements, and the setting is very good for smaller weddings. Suitability as a Wedding Venue: The Three Towers Eco Lodges are very suitable for smaller, more romantic weddings. This is due to the secluded settings, which present an opportunity for a fairytale theme! Salthill Hotel If your ideal wedding location is classy, spacious, and purpose-built for accommodating people and features a view of the Atlantic, then Salthill Hotel is for you. The premier luxury destination, Salthill Hotel has dedicated indoor facilities and an air that clearly suggests ‘champagne and caviar’! The panoramic views of the ocean, coupled with the plethora of facilities, not to mention several centres for weddings and parties, all make Salthill Hotel perfect for a traditional semi-indoors weddings with a view. Visual Appeal: The hotel is best summed up as the consummate indoors wedding venue, with facilities geared towards celebratory events such as parties and weddings. The attention to detail in the contemporary décor and effortless style make it great for larger weddings. General Ambience: A contemporary indoor setting makes for a sophisticated ambience, albeit with no shortage of classic craic, once the drinks start flowing! Since it is of a more social orientation, loud celebrations and parties can be expected, especially if there is a large number of guests attending the wedding! Suitability as a Wedding Venue: The place is literally optimised for weddings, making it perfect for matrimonial celebrations. Ashford Castle And now, the dream wedding venue, and a destination for both the imaginative and the historically-inclined, the biggest and often voted best wedding venue in Ireland! Ashford Castle is situated in Cong, which is middle ground between the counties Galway and Mayo. A grand building with various accommodation options, it is the ultimate in grandeur and classic style, being of course, an Irish castle! There is so much to choose from in terms of both indoor and outdoor event spaces, and all within the castle and grounds. The large spaces, all of which hark back to the days of horseback travel and blade combat, are marvellously designed and updated to feature the best of luxury and modern finery. Visual Appeal: In terms of sheer visual magnificence, Ashford Castle is perhaps unmatched. This is partly due to the medieval roots, and partly because of the modern adjustments made afterwards, during the later expansion period. The rooms, of which there are many, are themed according to ancient traditions, and feature some of the finest décor available. Impressive is all respects, Ashford Castle is a sight to behold, both up close and from a distance. General Ambience: The ambience is decidedly a mixture of old and new, with the ‘new’ aspect of the castle Suitability as a Wedding Venue: Since there are options for wedding arrangements both inside and out of the castle, the suitability factor is definitely there. It is one of the more expensive venues, which is not surprising, since it is a castle, after all! If cost is immaterial, then Ashford Castle can be the perfect wedding venue. Definitely one of the best wedding venues in Ireland!

Title: The Benefits of Booking an Exclusive Venue for Your Wedding - Vasilias Nikoklis Inn - Cyprus wedding venue

Content: Your Wedding day should be one of the most memorable days of your life and there is no doubt that your deepest desire is for everything to run as smoothly as possible and be stress-free. Choosing an exclusive venue for your wedding and reception is one way that you can ensure that is what happens on the big day. While it may be nice to share one of the happiest days of your life with your family and close friends, doing it at a venue where others may be eating and drinking may not be exactly what you had in mind when you started making your wedding plans. Choosing somewhere to hold your wedding ceremony and reception that is for the exclusive use of you and your guests will add an intimate and romantic aspect that many bigger venues are unable to provide. In this article, we look at some of the benefits that couples will enjoy when booking an exclusive venue for their intimate and romantic wedding. A one-stop wedding shop One of the great benefits that couples have when booking an intimate and romantic venue in Cyprus for their wedding is having a dedicated wedding planning team at their disposal. With food, accommodation, and every other aspect of your wedding all available in one location, you will be free to focus on making the most of your special day. From the pre-wedding drinks and meal with your friends and family to the details of the wedding itself, an expert team with an exclusive venue will make the difference that counts. Everything including photography, the cake, and the venue decoration can be taken care of on the happy couple’s behalf. Keeping everyone together Most couples who plan for an intimate wedding abroad usually fly to their chosen destination with their family and close friends. Staying at the same exclusive venue makes a great deal of sense in terms of transport and ensuring that everyone gets there on time too. Being able to relax together before the wedding with good food and drink in a tranquil atmosphere is also very important not just for those attending the celebration but especially for the couple. An exclusive venue that provides comfortable accommodation and delicious food for everyone in the run-up to the wedding also saves everyone the hassle of travelling to restaurants and booking into separate hotels. Creating an intimate and romantic atmosphere While many large hotels do offer dedicated wedding planning and hosting services, they can tend to be rather impersonal with quite often hundreds of other people staying in the hotel and sharing the facilities. When it comes to creating an intimate and romantic atmosphere for your wedding that is personal to you, a venue that is reserved exclusively for your wedding party will make the day so much more special and memorable. Smaller, intimate venues that are removed from the hustle and bustle of the main resorts and towns are usually set in the beautiful open countryside and there are a few such gems to be found if you know where to look. The atmosphere is everything on the day and it takes the perfect location and a dedicated and professional wedding venue team to make sure that everything comes together as and when it should. The benefits of onsite accommodation Finding an exclusive wedding venue in Cyprus that provides the right kind of accommodation is a crucial factor in making a success of your big day. The couple and their guest will be able to relax with a nice meal and a good night’s sleep before their special day and that is why choosing good quality onsite accommodation can make or break the big day. If you are fortunate enough to discover a venue that combines a romantic and intimate atmosphere with every modern facility such as ensuite bathrooms, you are on the right track. A luxury swimming pool and some authentic surroundings will also go a long way towards creating the ideal location for your dream intimate wedding. Combining these with a venue that is for the exclusive use of your wedding party and no one else and there is very little else any discerning couple could ask for.

There are lots to choose from now and most can cover a range of musical styles from pop to rock and jazz. Just remember to book one that is fully self-contained with its own PA and speakers. This is just much easier and one less thing for you to do! It is also worth hiring a band from the local area to save money on paying their travel and accommodation costs. To really make it more personal, you can ask the band to play songs that mean something to you and your guests. Hire a wedding photo booth Photos are a fun part of any wedding.

Title: Setting the Tone for the Big Day

Content: Erin S. Do you have an exact vision for your big day? Can you see the way the venue is lit providing the perfect ambiance, or your friends and families dressed to the nines to celebrate? It’s your wedding day and you should be dreaming big. Here’s a few tips to ensure that the wedding you’ve been envisioning is the wedding you experience! Engagement Photoshoot The photographs from your engagement photoshoot are usually incorporated on your save-the-dates and sometimes even your wedding invitations. Whether you want a casual wedding or a more formal wedding, set the tone right from the minute your guests get your save-the-dates! If you and your partner want to focus on enjoying yourselves and don’t have expectations for everyone’s wardrobe selection, then wear whatever feels natural for the photoshoot. Whether you’re going for classic styles ranging from casual day to day outfits to looks that are dressier, you should consider a brand like Torrid as they have a wide range of options that you’re sure to feel comfortable and confident in. Consider using an online consignment shop to save on your unique Torrid styles and maybe you’ll find through your savings that you can splurge on extra time with the photographer! On the contrary, if you’ve been picturing the big day with a little more extravagance, choose to sport an outfit that is on that next level. To avoid buying yet another expensive and formal dress, consider a subscription service and get access to rented LeTote designers saving you money and space in your closet. When your guests see these photos they will start to have an idea for the kind of effort you’re putting into the wedding. Invitations Your invitation is another great signal to your guests for the caliber of the wedding you’re hoping to have. The quality of the paper or its design shows guests how much you’re investing in the wedding. Ornate invitations say that you care about the attention to detail and that you are planning your wedding to be exquisite. The invitation is also an opportunity to be forthcoming about your expectations in terms of dress code and you can make your wishes explicit. If you’re unsure how to fit it into your invitation check out how others have done it before or refer to the handy Honeytree guidethat is sure to help you convey the dress code to your guests. Wedding Website A sure fire way to communicate with your wedding guests is by giving them all the details they need to know to help make your big day right by putting information on your wedding website. Keep everyone in the know with the most up to date itinerary. If possible, make yourself a mailing list in your email so that you can blast out your website’s address when there are updates. This will help make sure everyone knows exactly where they are supposed to be and when. Be certain that you’re covering your bases and that you provide all the necessary wedding information to your guests and they are sure to help the day go as you wish!

Title: Last-minute Tips to Get You Ready for the Big Day

Content: Getting married is one of the most beautiful and rewarding experiences of any person’s life, but what comes with it is organization and even stress. There are so many things to get done before the big day, it can be easy to get overwhelmed by the preparation that comes with it. To make sure your ceremony is stress-free and memorable, try out our last-minute tips to make sure you’re ready to walk the aisle with confidence and reassurance! Get Organized The first step in having the perfect wedding starts with a little organization. It takes a lot of vendors and outside resources to make a ceremony run smoothly. It’s best to create a folder or file to keep all your contracts handy. Make sure to double-check the requirements for each vendor, know the dates for payment and keep track of extra cash for tips, which will help ensure that you have no hiccups during your special day. To avoid disaster, be sure to follow up with your vendors at least a week before your wedding to make sure everything is all set and ready for the day of. A lot of the times, these arrangements are scheduled months, even years ahead of the actual date, so following up with everyone is never a bad idea. Designate an area for wedding gifts No wedding is complete without wedding gifts and to be sure everything runs smoothly, figure out who will be in charge of all of the gifts that come in from guests. Start with designating an area of the venue where you will store the presents and combine it with a person responsible for keeping track of all of them. This is a rather simple task, but not having to worry about it as the bride and groom will surely relieve any headaches. For the bride: Perfect your look Considering your wedding day is the most important date for any bride, and it’s your day to feel absolutely beautiful around friends and family, it’s only right that you make the final preparations to ensure you look your best. Starting with your wedding dress, be sure to get your final dress fittings done ahead of time, to be certain that your dress fits like a glove before walking down the aisle. Next, make sure your footwear is appropriate for the ceremony. Glancing at the weather (if it’s outdoors) can help with this, however, making sure your shoes are comfortable and broken in can separate a good wedding from a great wedding. Test walk in your heels and mix it in with a pair of flats to throw on for the after-party to free up the pressure on your feet. Finally, nail down your beauty regime and timeline. Perfect hair and makeup are essential for any bride, and this often takes special appointments and lengthy amounts of time. Be proactive in your scheduling and make sure all your appointments line up before your special day. A great way to do this is having your hair and makeup artist meet you at the venue, this way your entire bridal party can look great with minimal hassle! For the groom: Stay groomed and responsible While it might seem less stressful for men to get ready for the big day, there are still steps to follow to avoid a grooming disaster. Start with making sure your hair is up to the part. Visit the barber at least a week before your wedding to get a haircut that will have you looking sharp and handsome before walking the aisle. Your barber might even have the perfect suggestion of a style to have you testing out a new look. Once your hairstyle is on point, it’s essential to match it perfectly with your facial hair. Seek out a high-quality men’s razor to help you shave or sculpt your beard before your friends and family see you. While your hair trimming should be about a week before, the best time to shave is a couple of days before the ceremony. Depending on things like, how fast your hair grows and what length you’re going for, figure out a schedule ahead of time of what will work best for you. When it comes to clothing, make sure everything is steamed and prepared. From shirts to socks, lay your outfit out the night before and make sure everything is perfect. If you plan on specific garments special to the wedding, make sure those are located and ready to be worn! Other responsibilities to get squared away include accounting for the rings and practicing your vows. Remembering to breathe is never a bad idea! Figure out transportation Finally, it will be beneficial to figure out transportation to and from your wedding, since there will be so many people in the same location at once. As the bride and groom, make sure your limousine ride is all set to ensure you arrive on time and safely. For guests, look into ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft, which make it increasingly easier for guests to catch a ride. However, if you wish to avoid this route, look into getting shuttles for guests or even buses that can provide designated drivers. This will be sure to provide the safest option possible for you and your guests! As your wedding day approaches, remember to remain positive, calm, and organized. This should be the best day of your life, so don’t let minor things take away from the celebration!

Title: Grooming for the Groom: Routines to Start Before the Wedding

Content: Congratulations! You’re engaged, and you’ve finally settled on a date for the wedding. Whether your special day is one month from now or one year from now, you’ve still got a lot of planning to do. While wedding preparation for the bride is arguably slightly more intense than that of a groom, that doesn’t mean you as the future husband don’t need some prep as well! Down below are a few routines that you should have in place before your wedding to make sure that you’re confident for the big day. 1. Body Take care of your health Before your wedding, you want to make sure that you’re feeling your best. This means making sure to schedule any doctor’s visits that you may need before your wedding. Battling poor health before your big day is a sure way to increase stress and anxiety, potentially affecting your pre-wedding joy. Engaging in healthy habits like eating fruits and vegetables can help keep your health in check and help prevent you from needing serious medical intervention before standing at the end of the aisle. Get your workouts in If you have a weight goal or desired body image in mind, creating a workout plan months before the wedding is key. Especially seeing as it can take months to see fitness results. And that’s with consistent exercise, correct form, and the right diet. So, to make sure you’re confident on your big day, get into the routine of exercising a few times a week. 2. Hair Visit the barber If you’re not used to seeing a barber regularly, now might be the time to start. At home trims and treatments are great occasionally, but there’s nothing better than letting a professional you trust tend to your hair. A professional knows exactly what to look for and how to make your hair look its best while maintaining its health. Getting into the habit of seeing a barber will prevent you from having to do anything drastic weeks before your wedding. Incorporate hair treatments Between barber’s visits, you still have to take care of your hair on your own time. This means developing a routine that consists of products that your hair needs. Having a moisturizing shampoo, hydrating conditioner, and a styling oil are great places to start. Additional products to incorporate are a deep condition treatment if you have dry, lackluster hair and hair loss solution like Finasteride for men if you are experiencing hair thinning. 3. Skin Consult a dermatologist If you experience problems with your skin, see a dermatologist before your wedding. They can help you to figure out the cause of your skin problem and the best course of action for fixing it. Everything from changing your pillowcases more often to trying a specialized skin treatment can help correct your problem areas. Even your diet can play a role in your skin, so make sure you’re eating healthy in the weeks leading up to your wedding. Try to reduce stress Stress can wreak havoc on your skin. While you can’t reduce all of your stress when planning the wedding, there are some things you can control. Your venue is one of them. Don’t wait until the last minute to choose a location. Do your research, and find a place that is beautiful yet functional. Weddings in Cyprus are ideal as the venues located there have a mix between modern facilities and timeless scenery, giving you the perfect picturesque wedding. 4. Teeth Visit a dentist Again, confidence and self-esteem are everything when it comes to preparing for a wedding. You want to make sure that anything that you may feel slightly insecure about is in tip-top shape for the big day. If your teeth are a source of stress, schedule an appointment with your dentist. Don’t put off that root canal, teeth whitening, or cavity filling any longer. Get these things fixed so you smile for wedding photos with ease without worrying over tooth pain or yellowness. Hopefully, this gives you an idea of some routines to start before your wedding day. Just remember, enjoy the day and don’t stress! Everything will work out perfectly.

Title: How Get the Most Out of Your Honeymoon

Content: Your wedding in day in Cyprus has come and gone and you’re proud to say, you’ve truly had the best day of your life. Now, cue the relaxation. A honeymoon is the time to let go of the stress wedding planning can cause and embrace the start of newlywed bliss. Whether you’ve booked a week in the Caribbean to lay on the beach or a backpacking trip through Europe, one thing’s inevitable; you want to make the most out of your one on on time with your new spouse. Keep reading for some tips to make this a trip you’ll remember for years to come. Choose a destination you’ll both enjoy Since the honeymoon is intended for both of you, it’s crucial you pick a place you’re both interested in visiting. Many couples who enjoy sipping umbrella drinks and relaxing on the beach opt for an all inclusive resort as their honeymoon destination. The options and locations are endless when it comes to vacationing at an all inclusive and you can truly leave reality and your worries behind! However, if you and your significant other are seekers of adventure, a more thrill seeking option like hiking trip or backpacking through Europe might be more your speed! Options for these types of adventures are also endless and will make for some great stories about how you saw the northern lights or bathed in a natural hot spring! Whether you’re the veg out and relax type or a non-stop thrill seeker, it’s important to agree on a honeymoon destination that makes you both happy! Plan excursions If you opt for an all inclusive beach honeymoon, it’s pretty likely your resort will offer excursions. These short trips will take you away from the resort on what can feel like a vacation inside your vacation. Through an excursion, you’ll experience some unique areas your honeymoon destination has to offer. If you’re unsure what excursions are available, visit your resort’s website or check in with the concierge upon your arrival for more info. Can you imagine snorkeling around the coral reefs of Hawaii or zip lining through the Costa Rica rainforest? What an experience! On the other hand, if you opt for a more adventurous honeymoon, everyday can be a new excursion! This type of honeymoon may also allow you to learn more about one another if faced with any bumps along the way of your trip! Get intimate Over the last year or so, most of your time and energy was devoted to wedding planning. This probably didn’t leave much room for intimacy with your significant other. A honeymoon is the perfect opportunity to reconnect in the bedroom or wherever you may be spending your nights. Guys, if the stress from planning a wedding and travelling has got you feeling a little inadequate in this area, be sure to pack some Sildenafil to keep things in check and make up for lost time. There’s nothing more exciting then getting to really know one another in an exotic location so be sure to make the most of it! Don’t be shy when it comes to eating and drinking One of the best parts of travelling is experiencing the cuisine in different destinations. If you’re staying at an all inclusive resort, chances are you’ve paid for your food and drink up front. Why not take full advantage and indulge in some delicious meals? Most resorts have themed restaurants on site. If you and your spouse are foodies, you may want to choose where you stay based on resorts with the best food. You can then plan your meals ahead by checking the resort website, or decide as you go. If you’re travelling through a country or to several destinations, you’ll also want to do some research before you go. Look into places the locals go in order to get the best experience that location has to offer. Either way, your skinny jeans may not fit them same when you arrive back home, but isn’t that what vacation’s all about? Honeymoons may vary in length of time and location chosen, but one thing holds true no matter the couple; a honeymoon is a vacation you’ve earned through planning a wedding and it’s an opportunity to spend one on one time together. Following these steps can help ensure you make the most of your experience before you head back to everyday reality.

Title: Why Choose Cyprus for Your Perfect Wedding Day -Vasilias Nikoklis Inn - Cyprus wedding venue

Content: One of the most important factors in planning for a successful wedding day must surely be the weather. While it is by no means the end of the world if it rains, every couple looks forward to those beautiful outdoor wedding pictures that they can treasure for the rest of their lives. This explains why so many couples choose to hold their weddings abroad and why Cyprus is one of their top choices for a wedding ceremony and reception in the sun. With an average in excess of 320 days of sunshine every single year, the sunny island of Cyprus is the perfect place for your wedding day, but there are plenty of other reasons why this beautiful country is such an ideal venue for wedding ceremonies and receptions. In this article, we will look at some of the reasons why so many happy couples have already chosen Cyprus for their weddings over the years and why you should follow their example and do the same. Guaranteed beautiful weather As we have already mentioned, Cyprus is one place where you won’t have to worry about the weather, but we appreciate that a warm sunny day may not be everyone’s ideal climate. If you love the idea of marrying in sunny Cyprus but you prefer a cooler climate, Cyprus may still be the place for your wedding. The stunning natural beauty of the Troodos Mountains provides a cool and pleasant environment even during the warmest months of the year and this cool air moves down towards the coast. Choosing the right venue for your Cyprus wedding allows couples to take advantage of the cool breezes that come down off the mountains and also in from the clear blue Mediterranean Sea up through the dry river valleys. Cyprus – the perfect place to explore Most couples that choose Cyprus for the location of their wedding also combine the event with a relaxing holiday and there is no shortage of places to visit on the Island. Steeped in a rich cultural history that dates back to before the roots of Christianity, Cyprus is packed full of interesting and fascinating places to explore. From ruined cities that date back to the Romans and Greeks to ancient religious shrines including the reputed birthplace of the mythical Goddess of love and sexual rapture Aphrodite herself. Whether you want to combine your Cyprus marriage with a relaxing sun, sea, and sand beach holiday, lounging around an exclusive luxury pool, or exploring the numerous historic sites, there is no shortage of things to do. Friendly and welcoming locals Something else that keeps European visitors coming back to Cyprus year after year is the friendly and welcoming Cypriot people. Many of those who have holidayed on the island have also chosen it as their wedding venue thanks to the warm and friendly welcome they received. Conversely, many couples that have married in Cyprus then continue to return for their holiday’s year on year. With English taught as a second language from primary school age upwards and a huge British influence following the countries governance of the island right up until 1960, many UK couples have described it as a home from home. Cypriots even drive on the same side of the road as UK drivers and the country has a modern highway network that is a joy to use with far less traffic than most other European countries. What makes the place so welcoming, however, is the people themselves who are among the most welcoming and friendly in the world. Delicious food and beautiful wines The Mediterranean diet has long been cited as one of the healthiest in the world and Cypriot food provides a tasty blend of the highly nutritious fair. From traditionally slow-cooked lamb kleftico to tasty vine leaves, olives, and locally grown fruits, Cyprus is one country where you could easily live exclusively off the bounty of the land. Famous for her potatoes and tomatoes, Cyprus produce is exported all over the world and when you taste the local cuisine you will instantly know why. The island is also ideal wine producing country and so you can rest assured that there will be plenty of fine wines to serve at your wedding meal. One of the unique facts about Cyprus wine is that unlike some other countries, the cheaper local table wine tastes absolutely beautiful. It is no surprise that there are several “wine routes” or excursions that visit some of the many wineries around the Island for tasting, history, and of course the odd bottle or two to enjoy after a hard days sightseeing. Exclusive and unique wedding venues Cyprus boasts huge areas of beautiful countryside that is home to a relatively small number of indigenous inhabitants and it follows that once you leave the major towns and resorts there is room to breathe.

Title: How to Look Beautiful from Head to Toe on Your Wedding Day

Content: As the spotlight is often on the bride(s) at a wedding, it makes sense you will want to feel pretty and elegant on the happiest day of your life. As lovely as having the guests' attention is, you might worry about selecting the wrong shoes, bag, or veil, causing you to second-guess your taste and preferences. Feel confident with every decision you make. Read the following tips on how to look beautiful from head to toe on your wedding day. Choose Matching Accessories Picking the perfect shoes or accessories might not feel easy, as there is likely a considerable amount of choice on offer. Instead of questioning colors, styles, and textures, browse Lace & Favour's top 20 matching wedding bags and shoes to select complementing items. Guaranteed, the coordinating items will refine your bridal look and provide extra confidence when walking down the aisle. It will ensure you don't need to think twice about incorporating a pair of shoes or a bag, as you'll have 100% confidence that they'll provide the perfect finishing touch. Attend Beauty Appointments in Advance Don't make the mistake of scheduling a cosmetic appointment days before your big day, as it will increase your risk of skin inflammation, an acne breakout, or a troublesome zit. For instance, a facial can help you develop fresh skin and a healthy glow, but it could cause temporary sensitivity, redness, or irritation. The problems are more likely if you have sensitive skin, too. Instead, you should attend an appointment many months or weeks before your wedding, as it may improve your complexion while providing time for any side effects to disappear, such as swelling or bruising. Also, avoid using new beauty products a week or two before your big day, as they could cause skin irritation and redness or trigger an allergic reaction. Find a Hairstyle That Suits You Feel gorgeous throughout your wedding by selecting a hairstyle that compliments your hair type and the shape of your face. Consult an experienced hairstylist to learn about the best bridal hairstyles, such as: ● A classic bun ● Half-up and half-down ● A low ponytail ● Beachy waves – perfect for a destination wedding ● Bouncy blow dry ● Braided buns Finding the perfect hairstyle before your big day will help banish nerves and ensure you appear stunning when exchanging vows with your other half. Organize a hair trial for you and your bridesmaids many weeks before your special day, as it will ensure you each feel confident when walking down the aisle - it’s also an opportunity to create fun memories with your bridal party! Perfect Your Nails You might be surprised how often your nails are on display during your big day. For instance, a wedding photographer might take a photo of your newly married hands, and many guests might be eager to see your wedding ring. Ensure you don't feel self-conscious by painting your nails in a beautiful color, such as light nude or pink. Visit a nail salon one or two days before you say "I do" to ensure you don't need to worry about chipping or dullness. Following these simple tips will help to ensure that you look and feel beautiful on your wedding day. Most of all though, remember that beauty is in the eye of the beholder and your own happiness is the key to looking your best!
